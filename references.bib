	abstract = {The Hubble constant, H0, or its dimensionless equivalent, "little h", is a fundamental cosmological property that is now known to an accuracy better than a few percent. Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a "cheat sheet" of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

In order to meet these challenges, and in order to open up new avenues for collaboration between users of multiple simulation platforms, we present yt (available at http://yt.enzotools.org/), an open source, community-developed astrophysical analysis and visualization toolkit. Analysis and visualization with yt are oriented around physically relevant quantities rather than quantities native to astrophysical simulation codes. While originally designed for handling Enzo's structure adaptive mesh refinement ({AMR}) data, yt has been extended to work with several different simulation methods and simulation codes including Orion, {RAMSES}, and {FLASH}. We report on its methods for reading, handling, and visualizing data, including projections, multivariate volume rendering, multi-dimensional histograms, halo finding, light cone generation and topologically-connected isocontour identification. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying algorithms yt uses for processing and visualizing data, and its mechanisms for parallelization of analysis tasks.},

	abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

Halos are identified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the mass around isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is Delta times the background. We calibrate fitting functions for the large scale bias that are adaptable to any value of Delta we examine. We find a {\textasciitilde}6\% scatter about our best fit bias relation. Our fitting functions couple to the halo mass functions of Tinker et. al. (2008) such that bias of all dark matter is normalized to unity. We demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos is higher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of Sheth, Mo, \& Tormen (2001), and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapse model for the rarest halos. Halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halos identified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos with the canonical Delta=200 overdensity by {\textasciitilde}10\%. In contrast to our previous results on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolves very weakly with redshift, if at all. We use our numerical results, both for the mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background split model for halo bias. We find that the peak-background split achieves a reasonable agreement with the numerical results, but {\textasciitilde}20\% residuals remain, both at high and low masses.},

	abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat {LCDM} cosmology and investigate its evolution at z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm ({FOF}), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} Msol/h {\textless} M {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} Msol/h, to {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 5\%. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20\%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by {\textasciitilde}20-50\%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

	abstract = {As quantum computers become available to the general public, the need has arisen to train a cohort of quantum programmers, many of whom have been developing classical computer programs for most of their careers. While currently available quantum computers have less than 100 qubits, quantum computing hardware is widely expected to grow in terms of qubit count, quality, and connectivity. This review aims to explain the principles of quantum programming, which are quite different from classical programming, with straightforward algebra that makes understanding of the underlying fascinating quantum mechanical principles optional. We give an introduction to quantum computing algorithms and their implementation on real quantum hardware. We survey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a succinct and self-contained fashion. We show how these algorithms can be implemented on {IBM}'s quantum computer, and in each case, we discuss the results of the implementation with respect to differences between the simulator and the actual hardware runs. This article introduces computer scientists, physicists, and engineers to quantum algorithms and provides a blueprint for their implementations.},

Since researchers generally believe that {NP}-complete problems are difficult because their search spaces have essentially no structure, the optimality of Grover's algorithm for unstructured search suggests (but does not prove) that quantum computers cannot solve {NP}-complete problems in polynomial time.Unlike other quantum algorithms, which may provide exponential speedup over their classical counterparts, Grover's algorithm provides only a quadratic speedup.

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle N\}
   is large, and Grover's algorithm can be applied to speed up broad classes of algorithms. Grover's algorithm could brute-force a 128-bit symmetric cryptographic key in roughly 264 iterations, or a 256-bit key in roughly 2128 iterations. As a result, it is sometimes suggested that symmetric key lengths be doubled to protect against future quantum attacks.},

The real analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix. Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms, and thus, probability amplitudes.},

              satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857 {GHz}. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of
              Planck
              , which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter Œõ{CDM} model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well,
              Planck
              measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (

              Planck
              , the success of the Œõ{CDM} model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The
              Planck
              data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the

Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters.

We investigate the number of the above gates required to implement other gates, such as generalized Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2) transformation to one input bit if and only if the logical {AND} of all remaining input bits is satisfied. These gates play a central role in many proposed constructions of quantum computational networks. We derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of elementary gates required to build up a variety of two-and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number required for \$n\$-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some observations about the number required for arbitrary \$n\$-bit unitary operations.},

	abstract = {It is pointed out that most schemes for determining the mass function of virialized objects from the statistics of the initial density perturbation field suffer from the cloud-in-cloud problem of miscounting the number of low-mass clumps, many of which would have been subsumed into larger objects. The paper proposes a solution based on the theory of the excursion sets of F(r, Rf), the four-dimensional initial density perturbation field smoothed with a continuous hierarchy of filters of radii R sub f.},
